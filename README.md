# recording_defaults
Scripts and Settings to help with recording on Linux

The python script allows you to quickly with a shortcut redirect wine applications to a audio sink.

You can use my example files for pipewire to quickly get the two sinks I use by default. Any application that uses these sinks will also be sent to your default headphones/speakers. Then you can capture the sink directly in OBS and have audio channels with only the game or just your voicechat.
